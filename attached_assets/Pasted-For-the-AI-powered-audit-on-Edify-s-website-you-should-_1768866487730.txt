For the AI-powered audit on Edify’s website, you should implement a hybrid approach: use multiple-choice answers to capture interest and reduce friction initially, then transition to open-ended text responses for deeper discovery and agitation of pain points.
This strategy respects the Behavioral Architecture of Conversion by capturing "System 1" (instinctive) interest before engaging "System 2" (logical) processing.
1. Start with Multiple Choice to Reduce Friction
The initial stage of your audit should focus on Cognitive Ease and reducing the visitor's mental effort.
• Leverage Hick’s Law: Every additional choice increases decision time; by providing clear, pre-set buttons, you prevent "analysis paralysis" and guide the user through the start of the funnel.
• Enable Self-Segmentation: Use multiple-choice buttons to let the Hawaii SMB owner self-identify their needs (e.g., "I need more local leads" or "My site looks outdated"). This allows the AI to tailor the rest of the experience to their specific business model.
• The Zeigarnik Effect: By using a "micro-commitment" approach where they just have to click a button, you build momentum. Once they start, they feel a psychological compulsion to finish the process.
2. Transition to Text Responses for Diagnostic Depth
Once the prospect is "invested" in the audit, you should use text-based inputs to uncover their specific motivations through the SPIN Selling framework.
• Uncover Hidden Pain: Multiple-choice options can be limiting. Allowing users to respond in text lets them articulate nuanced objections and specific growth bottlenecks they might not have a button for.
• Prove You Are a "Guide": In the Hawaii market, being a "trusted advisor" is critical [511, Turn 8]. Asking an open-ended question like, "What is the one thing your current site isn't doing that is costing you the most money?" forces the prospect to emotionally connect with their pain.
• Listen to Understand: The sources emphasize that the more a prospect talks, the easier it is to diagnose their problem. In a digital sense, a text response acts as the prospect "talking," which builds Emotional Trust because the AI (and later your human team) can reflect their exact language back to them.
