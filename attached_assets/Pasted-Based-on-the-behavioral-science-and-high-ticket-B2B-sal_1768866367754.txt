Based on the behavioral science and high-ticket B2B sales frameworks provided in the sources, an audit for Edify, Limited is not a technical inspection, but a strategic diagnostic tool designed to reveal "gaps" in a prospect's execution and quantify the "cost of doing nothing".
To effectively lead a Hawaii-based SMB owner to a "yes," the audit should be structured using the SPIN Selling (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-Payoff) and R4 frameworks.
1. The Situation (Contextual Discovery)
These questions establish the current state and build credibility by showing you understand their local business environment.
• "Can you walk me through the specific strategies you’ve used in the past to scale your business in the Islands?".
• "What metrics or KPIs are you currently using to measure the success of your online presence?".
• "In your first 10 seconds on your current site, is it crystal clear what you offer to a new visitor?".
2. The Problem & Agitation (Identifying Roadblocks)
Use these to help the prospect articulate their frustrations and the limitations of their current setup.
• "What is the biggest bottleneck preventing your business from hitting its growth targets right now?".
• "What is happening online that might be impacting your local reputation (Kuleana) negatively without you realizing it?" [561, Turn 8].
• "Are you using templates that make you look like every other competitor, or does your site reflect the premium status you’ve earned?".
3. The Implication (The "Inaction Math")
These questions agitate the pain by exploring the secondary consequences of the problem, utilizing Loss Aversion.
• "If you lose just one high-value local lead per month because of a confusing user flow, what is the actual annual revenue loss to your business?".
• "If you don’t address these 'silent' technical roadblocks now, how will that affect your ability to compete in the next six months?".
• "How is this digital friction currently affecting your team’s morale or your ability to focus on high-level strategy?".
4. The Gap Analysis (R4 & V.A.L.U.E. Audit)
Use your proprietary frameworks to show the prospect what they are missing.
• Reputation: "How are you proactively capturing and spreading the 'good word' of your satisfied customers across the web?".
• Resale: "What automated systems do you have in place to bring your existing 'Ohana' of customers back for repeat business?" [562, Turn 8].
• Visibility: "Is your site structured to be found by modern AI-driven search tools like ChatGPT, or is it hidden from 40% of your potential traffic?".
5. Need-Payoff (Future Pacing)
Ask the prospect to visualize the solution, letting them "sell" themselves on the value of working with Edify.
• "If we could eliminate these bottlenecks and automate your lead flow, how would that change the way you operate your business daily?".
• "What would need to happen during this audit for our partnership to feel like a no-brainer investment for your growth?".
• "Imagine your website working harder than your best salesperson—what does your business look like 12 months from now?".
6. The "Silent Pause" & Objection Decoding
After asking a difficult question or presenting a gap, pause for 3-5 seconds. This often prompts the prospect to reveal their true underlying concerns regarding budget or trust.
• "I understand price is a concern. Could you help me understand: is it too expensive compared to what you’ve seen before, or are you unsure if it will work for your specific situation?".
"Use This Today" Exercise: During your next audit, replace the question "What do you want your site to look like?" with "What is the one thing your current site isn't doing that is costing you the most money right now?" This shifts the conversation from aesthetics to Earning Potential
