🧠 SEO FOR A WEB APP (EDIFY-LEVEL)

⚠️ First, the core issue

Most web apps:
	•	Render content client-side (React/Vue/etc.)
	•	Hide text behind JS
	•	Lack crawlable landing pages

Google can index JS now — but marketing SEO performs far better with server-rendered or static pages.

So we split SEO into two layers.

⸻

🧩 LAYER 1: SEO LANDING PAGES (CRITICAL)

🔑 Rule

Your SEO pages should not be your app UI.

They should be:
	•	Static or server-rendered
	•	Text-rich
	•	Conversion-focused
	•	Crawlable without JS

Best setup (what I recommend for you)

Since you already use Vercel:
	•	/ → SEO homepage
	•	/services/web-design
	•	/services/seo
	•	/small-business-websites
	•	/about
	•	/contact

Then:
	•	/app or /dashboard → actual web app

This is how top SaaS companies do it.

⸻

🧠 LAYER 2: APP SEO (LIMITED BUT IMPORTANT)

Inside the app:
	•	Set dynamic <title> and <meta description>
	•	Use clean URLs
	•	Add proper headings (<h1>, <h2>)
	•	Avoid blank screens before load

But don’t rely on the app alone to rank.

⸻

🚀 HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS FAST (STEP-BY-STEP)

1️⃣ Create a marketing shell (1–2 pages minimum)

Even one strong page can rank.

Minimum SEO homepage structure:
	•	H1: What you do + who for
	•	Subheadline: Outcome
	•	3–5 sections of real text
	•	FAQ
	•	CTA

2️⃣ Use Server-Side Rendering or Static Export

If using Next.js:
	•	Use app/ router with metadata
	•	Use generateStaticParams where possible
	•	Avoid heavy client-only rendering above the fold

If not, we can still optimize — just less ideal.
3. Metadata next.js example: export const metadata = {
  title: "Small Business Web Design & SEO | Edify Limited",
  description:
    "Edify builds clear, conversion-focused websites for small businesses. Book a free strategy call."
4️⃣ SEO-First Hero Copy (Web App Friendly)

Your visible text still matters, even in apps.

Example H1:

Web Design That Helps Small Businesses Grow

Google weights visible text heavily.

⸻

5️⃣ FAQ Schema (Huge Advantage for Apps)

Add FAQs at the bottom of SEO pages.

Why?
	•	Adds crawlable content
	•	Ranks for long-tail
	•	Builds trust

I can generate schema JSON for you.

⸻

6️⃣ Blog / Content (Optional but Powerful)

If you add:
	•	/learn or /blog

You unlock:
	•	Informational search traffic
	•	Trust
	•	Funnel warm-ups

Even 3–5 strong articles can move the needle.

⸻

🔥 PRO MOVE (MOST IMPORTANT FOR EDIFY)

Create a separate SEO marketing site on:
	•	edifyltd.com or www.edifyltd.com
Then link the app.

This avoids fighting Google with JS.

⸻

🧠 TL;DR
	•	Web apps ≠ SEO pages
	•	You need a marketing layer
	•	Vercel + Next.js = perfect stack
	•	One great SEO page beats 10 weak ones
