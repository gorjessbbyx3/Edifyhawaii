Each service page must include:
	•	H1 with intent
	•	Clear explanation of the problem
	•	Your process
	•	Outcomes
	•	FAQ (huge SEO boost)
	•	CTA

⸻

5️⃣ FAQ SCHEMA (ADVANCED, EASY WIN)

Add FAQs that match real questions people search:

Examples:
	•	“How much does a small business website cost?”
	•	“How long does it take to build a website?”
	•	“Do I own my website?”

These:
	•	Rank for long-tail searches
	•	Trigger rich results
	•	Build trust

If you want, I can write FAQ schema code for you.

⸻

6️⃣ INTERNAL LINKING (SILENT POWER)

Every page should link to:
	•	1 service page
	•	1 authority page (About / Process)
	•	1 conversion page (Contact)

Example:

“Learn more about our small business web design process.”

Google uses this to understand site hierarchy.

⸻

7️⃣ CONTENT THAT ACTUALLY RANKS (NOT BLOG FLUFF)

Instead of generic blogs, write buyer-intent content:

High-value article ideas
	•	“How Much Should a Small Business Website Cost in 2026?”
	•	“Why Most Business Websites Don’t Convert”
	•	“Website Redesign vs New Website: What’s Right for You?”

Each article should:
	•	Answer the question clearly
	•	Funnel to a service page
	•	Position Edify as the guide

⸻

8️⃣ LOCAL SEO (IF YOU WANT CLIENTS FAST)

If you serve a location:

Must-haves
	•	Google Business Profile
	•	Same business name, phone, site everywhere
	•	Location page (even if remote)

Example page:

9️⃣ TECH SEO (KEEP IT CLEAN)

Make sure:
	•	Fast load times (Vercel helps here)
	•	Mobile-first layout
	•	Clean URLs
	•	Alt text on images
	•	Semantic HTML (header, main, section)

You don’t need fancy tools — just clean structure.

⸻

🔟 EEAT (WHAT GOOGLE REALLY CARES ABOUT)

Experience. Expertise. Authority. Trust.

Add:
	•	Real about page (who you are + why you do this)
	•	Process transparency
	•	Clear contact info
	•	Real examples (even small ones)
	•	Honest language

This is huge for service businesses.

⸻

🧠 PRO MOVE (EDIFY-LEVEL)

Add a page called:

“How We Design Websites That Convert”

This:
	•	Builds authority
	•	Ranks for informational queries
	•	Pre-sells clients before the call
